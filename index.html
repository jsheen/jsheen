<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in Marcia Castro's lab at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research interests include identifying ecological structures that influence the transmission and evolution of pathogens, causal inference and statistical trial designs to estimate effects of vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions, and legal complexities in policy to counteract pathogen transmission.<br><br>

Each of these projects concern ethical issues at their heart. What measures could be taken to decrease virulence factors of poultry pathogens in live-bird markets, given that they are closely tied to economic and nutritional sustainability in a community? Should cities have implemented eviction bans to alleviate infection burden? Do the benefits of self-disseminating animal vaccines outweigh their evolutionary risks? I am interested in addressing these kinds of questions.<br><br>

I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University. My adviser was C. Jessica E. Metcalf.</p>
